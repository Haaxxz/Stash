/**
 * Guards the restore safety gate: importDatabase must verify a staged backup
 * before it ever replaces the live database, so a truncated/corrupt backup can't
 * destroy the user's only library.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS CLASS. Robolectric's SQLite is far more
 * permissive than a device's, and these tests cover much less than they look
 * like they do. Measured directly on 2026-07-26:
 *   - it does NOT enforce `OPEN_READONLY` — a read-only handle accepts `INSERT`;
 *   - on a READ-WRITE handle it does NOT reject a corrupt file — a valid 16-byte
 *     SQLite header followed by pure junk opens fine and reports
 *     `integrity_check` = ok.
 *
 * So the ONLY part of the gate these unit tests genuinely verify is the explicit
 * header check in [DatabaseBackupManager.verifyDatabaseIntegrity]. The
 * `PRAGMA integrity_check` arm and the read-only/FTS interaction behind #370 are
 * device-only behaviours — verify those by exporting and re-importing on real
 * hardware, and do not let a green run here stand in for that.

     * The fixture above is a PLAIN table, and that hole shipped a 100%-broken
     * restore in v0.9.83 (#370).
     *
     * A real Stash backup contains `tracks_fts`, an FTS4 virtual table. On such a
     * database `PRAGMA integrity_check` doesn't just read pages — it dispatches
     * the FTS module's own check as `INSERT INTO tracks_fts(tracks_fts)
     * VALUES('integrity-check')`. That statement is write-SHAPED (it persists
     * nothing), so on a connection opened `OPEN_READONLY` SQLite throws
     * "attempt to write a readonly database" and EVERY import was rejected —
     * valid backups included — while this suite stayed green, because a plain
     * table never takes the FTS path.
     *
     * ⚠️ HONEST LIMIT: this test does NOT reproduce that bug, and adding an FTS
     * table is not enough to make it. **Robolectric does not enforce
     * `OPEN_READONLY`** — probed directly here on 2026-07-26: opening a database
     * READONLY and then running `INSERT` SUCCEEDS under Robolectric, where a real
     * device throws. So the read-only-vs-FTS interaction is invisible to every
     * JVM unit test in this repo, and no test here can guard it. The #370 fix was
     * verified the only way it can be: export→import on a physical device.
     *
     * What this test IS worth: it pins that a backup shaped like a REAL one (an
     * FTS4 virtual table present, matching TrackFts) is accepted by the gate, so
     * a future change that rejects FTS databases for some other reason gets
     * caught. Don't mistake it for a guard on the read-only bug.
