/**
 * Radar-style tuning indicator drawn AROUND the radio icon (spec §1,
 * mockup option B). Two layers on one Canvas:
 *
 *  - a faint full "track" ring, always on while [tuning] or [lock] shows;
 *  - a 40° arc that rotates once per ~1.15s while [tuning]; when [lock]
 *    fires (station ready) the arc snaps to a full 360° circle which the
 *    caller fades out by dropping [lock] after [LOCK_HOLD_MS].
 *
 * Runs on every theme including AMOLED — this is icon-local feedback,
 * not an ambient background, so the pure-black no-op convention does
 * not apply.
